# Bilingual Brain Research<br>中英双语的脑科学研究

You are invited to take part in a research study on bilingual speech production. 
We use a brain imaging technique called MEG (magnetoencephalography), which 
<i>passively</i> records your brain activity while you perform a task. It is like an MRI but without the noise!

The test session takes approximately <b>100 minutes</b>, and you will receive <b>$40 cash</b> as a thank-you.

<b>Location:</b> Australian Hearing Hub, Macquarie University.
