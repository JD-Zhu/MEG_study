You are invited to take part in a research study on bilingual speech production. 
We use a brain imaging technique called <b>MEG</b> (magnetoencephalography), which 
<i>passively</i> records your brain activity while you perform a task. It is like an MRI but without the noise!

The study takes place at Macquarie University's <b>[MEG Brain Research Laboratory](https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-centres-groups-and-facilities/healthy-people/facilities/meg) (1 of only 2 in the southern hemisphere!)</b>, located in the Australian Hearing Hub. The test session takes approximately <b>100 minutes</b>, and you will receive <b>$40 cash</b> as a thank-you.

---

<b>Please ensure you satisfy the following criteria:</b>

* Age: 18 to 39
* Right-handed
* <b>Do not have any non-removable metal</b> in your body (e.g. braces, fixed retainers, crowns, screws, hearing aid, etc)
* Must be <b>highly proficient</b> in both Mandarin and English
* Do not speak any other languages (e.g. Cantonese, French)
* Spent <b>childhood</b> (0~6 years old) in a Mandarin-speaking environment
* Spent <b>at least 1/5 of your life</b> in an English-speaking environment
