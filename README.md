You are invited to take part in a research study on bilingual speech production. 
We use a brain imaging technique called <b>MEG</b> (magnetoencephalography), which 
<i>passively</i> records your brain activity while you perform a task. It is like an MRI but without the noise!

The study takes place at Macquarie's MEG Brain Research Laboratory (1 of only 2 in the southern hemisphere!), located in the Australian Hearing Hub:<br>

The test session takes approximately <b>100 minutes</b>, and you will receive <b>$40 cash</b> as a thank-you.
